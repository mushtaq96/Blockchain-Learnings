## About
This task requires me to build my own blockchain in Java language.
Result,
1. Accomplished a basic blockchain
2. Got to learn how to implement a simple POW (proof of work) or a mining algorithm which is at the core of all blockchain protocols.


# Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

# Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

# Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
